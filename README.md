# SECURE

This is a project group members and I have designed to explore product design and computer science!  This is a high level project that demonstrates high-fidelity prototypes (Figma), user testing and various product design features.

Project idea: Design an app that detects scam calls, emails, texts through LLMs and developing an efficent UI that allows users to seamlessly report these numbers and reduce interactions with scammers.
